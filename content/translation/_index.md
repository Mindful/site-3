I work as an English/Japanese sequential interpreter, where much of my experience has been in the form of interpreting panels and other interactions for conference guests.
<br/><br>
I can also translate documents, applications, and other text. My professional background makes me uniquely qualified to work on the translation projects relating to software development or natural language processing.
