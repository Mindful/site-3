I work as an English/Japanese sequential interpreter, where much of my experience has been in the form of interpreting panels and other interactions for conference guests.
<br/><br>
I can also translate documents, applications, and other text. My technical background makes me uniquely qualified to work on the translation projects relating to software development or natural language processing.

My relevant work experience can be seen in my translator/interpreter resume below.
