Hi there! My name is Joshua Tanner, and I currently work as a software engineer at [Mantra Inc.](https://mantra.co.jp/index_en.html) As an engineer, I work primarily in natural language processing and backend development, and I also occasionally work as a [translator and interpreter](/translation).
<br/><br>
If you are interested in working with me on something, please feel to reach out. I am most interested in
language-related projects - in particular those that support language learners - but I am always happy 
to hear about a good idea.
