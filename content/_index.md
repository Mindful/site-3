Hi there! 

I'm a software engineer, researcher and occasional translator/interpreter working at the intersection of technology and language. I work primarily in natural language processing (NLP) and backend development, with experience leading projects in environments from fortune-500 companies to emerging startups. 
<br/><br>
I am particularly interested in products or projects that aim to help language learners, but I have experience across a broad range of technologies in NLP, machine learning and software development. Please see my resume for details.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have a project you think I might be able to help with! Invitations for resesarch collaboration are welcome, and I also freelance as a technical consultant. Some of my past clients can be seen below.
